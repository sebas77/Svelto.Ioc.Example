# Svelto.Ioc.Example
Example for the Svelto.Ioc library https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.IoC

This is a complete unity project. It's not nice to see, but it does the job. If you have better examples, please let me know. The Svelto.IoC library is added as submodule, therefore it will point to its own repository.
